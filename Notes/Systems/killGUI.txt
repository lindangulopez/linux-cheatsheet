Killing the Graphical User Interface (Lab)

From within a graphical terminal (gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.), we kill the current graphical desktop.

Your method will depend on your distribution, your greeter program (gdm, lightdm, kdm), and whether you have a SysVinit or systemd system.

First, we will bring down the GUI, which, depending on your system, will be done with one of the following commands:
/*
$ sudo systemctl stop gdm
$ sudo telinit 3
*/

Now, we restart the GUI from the text console with one of the following commands:

/*

$ sudo systemctl start gdm
$ sudo telinit 5

*/
