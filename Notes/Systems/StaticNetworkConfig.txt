Static Configuration of a Network Interface (Lab)
Exercise

Note: You may have to use a different network interface name than eth0. Also note that you can most easily do this 
exercise with nmtui or your systemâ€™s graphical interface. We will present a command line solution, but beware, details 
may not exactly fit your distribution flavor or fashion.

    Show your current IP address and default route for eth0.
    /*
    $ ip addr show eth0
    */
    or
    /*
     $ ifconfig eth0
    */
    
    2. Assuming the address was 192.168.1.100: 
    Bring down eth0 and reconfigure to use a static address instead of DCHP, using the information you just recorded. 
        /*
$ sudo ip link set eth0 down 
$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100 dev eth0 
$ sudo ip link set eth0 up
    */
    
    or
    
    /*
    $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down 
$ sudo ifconfig eth0 up 192.168.1.100
    */
    
    Bring the interface back up.
        /*
    $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down 
$ sudo ifconfig eth0 up 192.168.1.100

    */
    
    or 
    /*
    $ sudo ifconfig eth0 up 
$ sudo dhclient eth0
    */
    Make sure your configuration works after a reboot.
        /*
    $ sudo reboot
    */

You will probably want to restore your configuration when you are done.
