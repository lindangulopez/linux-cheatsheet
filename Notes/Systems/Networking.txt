Networking and Network Interfaces

The vast majority of network programming in Linux is done using the socket interface. Thus, standards-compliant programs should require little 
massage to work properly with Linux.

Note, however, there are many enhancements and new features in the Linux networking implementation, such as new kinds of address and protocol 
families. For example, Linux offers the netlink interface, which permits opening up socket connections between kernel sub-systems and applications 
(or other kernel sub-systems). This has been effectively deployed to implement firewall and routing applications.

Historically, the wired Ethernet network devices have been known by a name such as eth0, eth1, etc., while wireless devices have had names like 
wlan0, wlan1, etc.

Basic information about active network interfaces on your system is gathered through the ifconfig utility:
/*
$ /sbin/ifconfig

*/
Information displayed includes information about the hardware MAC address, the MTU (maximum transfer unit), and the IRQ the device is tied to. 
Also displayed are the number of packets and bytes transmitted, received, or resulting in errors.

This machine has two network cards bound to eth0 and eth1, and the loopback interface, lo, which handles network traffic bound to the machine. 
Note you can see the statistical information in abbreviated form by looking at /proc/net/dev, and in one quantity per line display 
in /sys/class/net/eth0/statistics:
