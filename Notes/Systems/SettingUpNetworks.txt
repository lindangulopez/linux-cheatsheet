Networking and Network Interfaces (Cont.)

To bring a network connection up and assign a static address, you can do:
/*
$ sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up 192.168.1.100
*/

To bring it up and get it an assigned address from a DHCP server, you can do:
/*
$ sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
$ sudo /sbin/dhclient eth0

*/

While ifconfig has been used reliably for many years, the ip utility is newer (and far more versatile). On a technical level, 
it is more efficient because it uses netlink sockets, rather than ioctl system calls.

ip can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It can be used to display and control devices, routing, policy-based routing, and tunneling. 
The basic syntax is:

/*
ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }
*/

Some examples:

    Show information for all network interfaces:
    /*
$ ip link
*/

    Show information for the eth0 network interface:
    /*
$ ip -s link show eth0
*/

    Set the IP address for eth0:
    /*
$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.7 dev eth0
*/

    Bring eth0 down:
    /*
$ sudo ip link set eth0 down
*/

    Set the MTU to 1480 bytes for eth0:
    /*
$ sudo ip link set eth0 mtu 1480
*/

    Set the networking route:
    /*
$ sudo ip route add 172.16.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.5
*/
