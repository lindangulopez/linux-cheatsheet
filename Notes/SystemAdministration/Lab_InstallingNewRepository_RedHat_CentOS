Installing a New Repository on a Red Hat and CentOS (Lab)

Enterprise Linux distributors often offer only a relatively small subset of the total number of packages available and the versions 
supported are often not the latest cutting edge ones.

This is done to permit better control over package interaction as the potential number of problems tends to rise rather dramatically 
as more software is included.

However, there are many software packages that are well-understood and probably can be added without big problems. While one can always 
install from source, binary packages are much easier to deal with.

NOTE: This lab can only be done on a RHEL or CentOS system.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations (including CentOS), a handy resource is the EPEL repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise 
Linux). For the most part these are packages which have been used on Fedora systems, which are very similar to the current Red Hat 
system, and are expected to install cleanly and play well with the rest of the software on the system, although no technical support 
can be provided. 

To install the EPEL repository, you need to download the RPM file from the EPEL repository, selecting the version appropriate for your 
major release version.

You can then install as in:
$ sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release*.noarch.rpm

or, to be explicit:
$ sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-7.5.noarch.rpm

You will notice this creates a file, /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo which you should examine, as it is a template for how other repositories 
can be added.

You may already have the EPEL repository installed; for example, if you are using a Linux Foundation CentOS virtual machine. In such a 
case, just make sure you know how to obtain the RPM file and examine /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo.
