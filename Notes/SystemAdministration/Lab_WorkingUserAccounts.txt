Working with User Accounts (Lab)

Create a user1 account using useradd.

Log in as user1 using ssh or su or sudo. For example, you can just do this with:
$ ssh user1@localhost

It should fail, because you need a password for user1; it was never established.

Set the password for user1 to user1pw and then try to log in again as user1.

Look at the new records which were created in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group.

Look at the /etc/default/useradd file and see what the current defaults are set to. Also look at the /etc/login.defs file.

Create a user account for user2 which will use the Korn shell (ksh) as its default shell. (If you do not have /bin/ksh, install it or use the C shell at /bin/csh.) Set the password to user2pw.
