Adding to the Path (Lab)

Create a simple executable file with the name ls in your current directory, which we will assume to be /tmp:

$ cd /tmp
$ echo echo Hello, This is MY ls program > ls
$ chmod +x ls

You can run this directly by doing:
$ ./ls

but just typing ls will bring up the normal /bin/ls, which can be verified by typing which ls.

If you do:

$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

then typing ls will bring up your program no matter where you are sitting on the filesystem.

///////////////////WARNING//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This is different than doing:
$ export PATH=./:$PATH
which puts the current directory first in the path, no matter where you are, or
$ export PATH=$CWD:$PATH

which will put the current working directory at this time in your future path.

Prepending your current directory to the path is generally a bad idea, as it makes trojan horses easy to implement.
