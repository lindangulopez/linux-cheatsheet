Pipes

Each step in a pipeline is a separate shell; i.e. there is a true pipeline. Be careful with redirection. Also |& does not work.

cat nofile | grep string produces an error if nofile does not exist.

cat nofile | grep string 2>errs does not work.

cat nofile 2>&1 | grep string > errs does not work.

cat nofile 2>errors | grep string does work.

The tee utility can be very useful for saving output while still looking at the screen:

$ foobar | tee filename
$ foobar 2>&1 | tee filename

Exercise

Try a command such as the following:

$ ls /etc/passwd /etc/passwd_not

where one file exists and the other does not.

Get the stdout output of the command in one file and the stderr output in another.

Now get them both to go to the same file.

Now get the stderr output to go away to /dev/null.

Now pipe the result of the ls command into sort, and get the stderr output into a separate file.
