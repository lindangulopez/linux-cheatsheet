Redirection

File descriptors:

    0 = stdin
    1 = stdout
    2 = stderr

less < file same as less file or less 0< file

foo > file ; redirect stdout (same as foo 1> file)

foo 2> file ; redirect stderr

foo >> file ; append stdout to file

foo >& file or foo > file 2>&1;

sends stdout and stderr to a file, but foo >>& file does not work ; you have to do foo >> file 2>&1

Note that foo > file 2>&1 is not the same as foo 2>&1 > file; the order of arguments is important.

A nice non-portable trick you can use in Linux is to take advantage of the device nodes:

/dev/stdin
/dev/stdout
/dev/stderr

$ foo > /dev/stderr
